# Instadective

Instadective is a simple command-line tool uses Instagram's API (using `instagrapi`) to gain various insights about your Instagram account along with changes to followers and following over time.

## Features

- Detects users you follow that don't follow you back on Instagram.
- Detects change in follower/following between two scans.
- Scans your account to store your followers and following locally which can be used later.
- Uses your Instagram `sessionid` to do so.
- Uses Instagram's official API via `instagrapi`.

## Installation

You can directly install `instadective` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install instadective
```

Also, you can clone the Github repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozaxn/Instadective.git
cd Instadective
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To display help, run:
```bash
instadective -h
```

This will show something similar to:
```bash
